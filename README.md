# Conversion Tool

### The Conversion Tool is a simple command-line utility built in Python that allows users to convert between different units of measurement. It provides functionalities to convert miles to kilometers, degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit, and degrees Celsius to Kelvin.

# Features:

### Miles to Kilometers Conversion: Users can input the distance in miles, and the tool will convert it to kilometers using the standard conversion factor of 1 mile = 1.609 kilometers.

### Degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion: Users can input temperature in degrees Celsius, and the tool will convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula (°C × 9/5) + 32.

### Degrees Celsius to Kelvin Conversion: Users can input temperature in degrees Celsius, and the tool will convert it to Kelvin by adding 273.15 to the Celsius temperature.

# How to Use:

### Run the script in a Python environment.

### Choose the conversion option you want (1 for Miles to Kilometers, 2 for Celsius to Fahrenheit, 3 for Celsius to Kelvin).

### Enter the required input (miles, degrees Celsius).

### The tool will display the converted result.

# Usage:

### This tool is useful for anyone who needs quick and easy conversions between different units of measurement.

# Future Enhancements:

### Future versions of the Conversion Tool could include additional conversion functionalities, support for more units of measurement, and the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
